# wz-reader-rs
Maplestory *.Wz file reading written in rust, try port similer code from [WzComparerR2.WzLib](https://github.com/Kagamia/WzComparerR2/tree/master/WzComparerR2.WzLib) and [MapleLib](https://github.com/lastbattle/MapleLib)

It a rust learning project, performance maybe not as good as C#. And not plan to support WzIv currently.
